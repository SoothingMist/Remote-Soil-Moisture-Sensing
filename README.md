# Remote-Soil-Moisture-Sensing

Employs language-standard C++, Arduino Uno, and Uno-compatible LoRa transceivers to implement soil-moisture radio broadcasts.  Uses PC-Uno serial connectivity. No third-part services are involved. Windows PC acts as base station.

The first stage of the overall effort in precision irrigation is available: https://github.com/SoothingMist/Embeddable-Software-for-Irrigation-Control.
